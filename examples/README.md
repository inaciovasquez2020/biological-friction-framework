Examples — Biological Friction Framework

Purpose
Concrete, minimal instantiations of biological friction under capacity, energy, and regulatory constraints.
Examples are illustrative, not simulations.

All examples respect:
- finite information capacity
- irreducible metabolic cost
- non-zero regulatory lag

Status: Canonical examples
