# Biological Friction Framework

This repository contains reference materials for the **Biological Friction Framework**, a component of the broader research program on structural rigidity and finite information systems.

## Overview

The Biological Friction Framework studies invariant-based limits on biological computation and information flow under friction-like structural constraints.

The core idea is that biological systems exhibit irreducible operational costs analogous to physical friction, which impose hard limits on:

- Information throughput  
- Adaptive refinement  
- Predictive control  
- Long-horizon coordination  

These limits are formalized using invariant and rigidity principles shared with the Unified Rigidity Framework (URF).

## Scope

This repository serves as:

- A reference container for definitions and models
- A conceptual bridge between physics-style rigidity and biological systems
- A structural module within the URF ecosystem

Some materials may be conceptual or in-progress.
