## Significance Statement
The **Biological Friction Framework** formalizes the irreducible operational costs that impose hard limits on information throughput in biological structures. By applying **URF Rigidity Principles**, we identify invariant-based obstructions that prevent arbitrary refinement in adaptive systems, defining the "Friction Wall" of biological computation.

## Overview
This repository investigates the structural constraints that dictate:
* **Information Throughput:** The upper bound of signal fidelity in noisy biological channels.
* **Adaptive Refinement:** The limits of evolutionary optimization within rigid structural invariants.
* **Predictive Control:** Invariant-based limits on long-horizon coordination.

## Mathematical Context
Biological "friction" is modeled as the spectral resistance of the system's transition operator. In the URF context, these systems are analyzed for:
$$\lambda_1(\Delta_{Bio}) \to 0$$
Where the collapse of the spectral gap characterizes the onset of biological "friction" or loss of coordination.
